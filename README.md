* Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  - Artemis Financial is a consulting company develops financial plans. They wanted to ensure the safety of their customer's infromation and use the most up to date and effective security.

* What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  - I feel I did best with going over the vulnerability assessments. It is import to code securely for numerous reasons, one being to protect your program's users which is great for both companies and individuals.

* What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  - The hardest part was figuring out which of the vulneribilities were false positives.

* How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  - I was able to add a checks sum, generate a selfsigned certificate and update to the latest maven. Personally I feel that implementing the maven checks along with JUnit tests would be best moving forward.

* How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  - Double checking the dependency reports really helped to see if I added any new risks. Re-running the code after every small fix also hepled to ensure that everything was working as intended.

* What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  - StackOverflow was a great resource for when I got stuck. I also had a seperate word file I kept open to save code I had previously used for instances where I felt I had to completely start over for a section.

* Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  - From this assignemtn I would show them the successful dependency checks and how the code ran successsfully.
